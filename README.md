[YaLlega](https://yallega.com.ar) is a simple web app to get precise information about nearby bus stops and the detail of the bus line of such stop. The user could get information about the position of the near bus stops and the approximate wait time for the next bus to come.

It used bus line real time APIs to gather information from different bus companies. This middlewares where removed from the public release since *transport companies sued about this information being private*.
